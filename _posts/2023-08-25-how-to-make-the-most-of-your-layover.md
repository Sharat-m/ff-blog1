Layovers can be a hassle, but they don't have to be a waste of time. With a bit of planning, you can turn a layover into an opportunity to explore a new city or experience a new culture. Here are some tips on how to make the most of your layover.

Before you arrive at your layover destination, do your research. Find out what attractions, restaurants, and activities are nearby. Check if the airport offers tours or transit options to explore the city. Make a list of must-see destinations and plan your time accordingly.

##  Check your baggage

If you have checked baggage, check if it will be automatically transferred to your final destination or if you need to collect and recheck it. If you have a long layover, consider checking your baggage into storage at the airport so you can explore without lugging around heavy bags.
 
##  Dress comfortably

Wear comfortable clothing and shoes, especially if you plan on doing a lot of walking. Dress in layers so you can adjust to different temperatures during your layover.

##  Use airport lounges

If you have access to airport lounges, take advantage of them. Lounges offer comfortable seating, Wi-Fi, and complimentary food and drinks. Some lounges even have shower facilities so you can freshen up before your next flight.

##  Consider airport hotels

If you have a long layover, consider booking a room at an airport hotel. This gives you the opportunity to rest and freshen up between flights. Some airport hotels offer day rates, which can be more affordable and convenient than booking a full night's stay.

##  Explore the airport

Make sure to set an alarm or reminder for your departure time. Give yourself plenty of time to get back to the airport, clear security, and find your gate. Allow extra time if you need to collect checked baggage or check in again.

##  Stay connected
